> Prompt: Built to Scale
### Game Description

Start as a tiny single-celled organism and fight through waves of endlessly spawned monsters and creatures. Survive the onslaught long enough to grow larger and larger in size until you belong in the solar system.

### About the Game

Starting off the game begin as a single-celled organism that shoots at the enemies automatically. If you can survive for two and a half minutes then you will be able to grow in size and meet new enemies. You completed the game once you turn into a planet and have to fight other celestial beings.

### How to Play

To start playing you can either pull the game and compile it using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to your machine's OS, or you can download the game for windows from [itch.io](https://therealtvmanager.itch.io/i-dont-want-to-be-single-celled-anymore).

### How this fits the theme

The theme for the GMTK game jam was built to scale, and in this game you initially start out as a small amoeba trying to fight off the endless number of enemies trying to prevent you from growing. When you have fought for long enough you increase in size and fight on a larger scale and bigger more powerful enemies, however you will still see those tiny pests try to tear you down. This game incorporates sizing into the player and enemies and makes those later stages and fights even more grand.
